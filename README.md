# ITSML-Uncertainty-Quantification

Due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications, 
many of which are coming with safety requirements, the notion of uncertainty has received 
increasing attention in machine learning research in the last couple of years. 
In particular, the idea of distinguishing between two important types of uncertainty, 
often refereed to as aleatoric(randomness) and epistemic(lack of information), 
has recently been studied in the setting of supervised learning. 
In this work, we propose to quantify these uncertainties with random forests. 
More specifically, we show a Bayesian approaches for measuring the learnerâ€™s aleatoric 
and epistemic uncertainty in a prediction can be instantiated with decision trees and random forests as learning algorithms 
in a classification setting.
